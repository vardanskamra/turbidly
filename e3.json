    "mainArticle": "The question of whether we are happier now as a society than in times past is a complex and multifaceted inquiry that elicits diverse perspectives from philosophers, sociologists, and historians. On one hand, proponents of progress argue that advancements in technology, medicine, and social welfare have improved overall well-being and quality of life for individuals around the globe. They point to indicators such as increased life expectancy, reduced poverty rates, and greater access to education and healthcare as evidence of societal progress and prosperity. From this perspective, contemporary society offers unprecedented opportunities for personal fulfillment, self-expression, and social mobility, fostering a sense of optimism and optimism about the future. However, skeptics of progress challenge this narrative, highlighting persistent social inequalities, environmental degradation, and existential anxieties that characterize modern life. They argue that despite material abundance and technological innovation, contemporary society is plagued by alienation, loneliness, and spiritual emptiness, leading to a crisis of meaning and purpose. Moreover, the relentless pursuit of economic growth and consumerism has led to a culture of hyper-individualism and instant gratification, eroding social bonds and undermining collective well-being. From this perspective, the quest for happiness in modern society is thwarted by systemic injustices and structural barriers that perpetuate inequality and marginalization. Beyond these contrasting views, philosophical debates about happiness and societal progress delve into deeper questions about the nature of happiness itself. Is happiness merely a subjective feeling of pleasure and satisfaction, or does it encompass broader dimensions of well-being, such as meaning, purpose, and social connection? Moreover, how do cultural norms, values, and beliefs shape our understanding of happiness and the good life? As society grapples with the challenges of the 21st century, the question of whether we are happier now than in times past remains an open and contentious issue, prompting reflection on the complexities of human existence and the pursuit of a more just and fulfilling society.",
