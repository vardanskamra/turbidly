    "mainArticle": "The assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, remains one of the most controversial events in modern history, fueling a plethora of conspiracy theories that challenge the official narrative of his death. Despite the Warren Commission's conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in shooting Kennedy from the Texas School Book Depository, doubts and skepticism surrounding the assassination persist to this day. One prevalent theory suggests that Oswald was part of a larger conspiracy involving multiple gunmen and shadowy figures with vested interests in removing Kennedy from office. Proponents of this theory point to inconsistencies in the official investigation, including the alleged mishandling of evidence and discrepancies in eyewitness testimonies, as evidence of a cover-up orchestrated to conceal the truth. Furthermore, the mysterious deaths of key witnesses and the suppression of classified documents related to the assassination have only fueled suspicions of a broader conspiracy at play. Over the years, various alternative theories have emerged, implicating entities ranging from organized crime syndicates to foreign governments in a plot to assassinate Kennedy. Some theorists speculate that Kennedy's advocacy for civil rights, his opposition to the military-industrial complex, and his efforts to de-escalate Cold War tensions made him a target for powerful interests seeking to maintain the status quo. Others suggest that elements within the government, including the CIA and the FBI, may have been complicit in the assassination due to disagreements over Kennedy's policies and leadership style. Despite lacking conclusive evidence, these theories continue to captivate the public imagination and raise profound questions about the nature of power, secrecy, and accountability in American politics. As new revelations emerge and old wounds are reopened, the legacy of John F. Kennedy's presidency remains indelibly linked to the enduring quest for truth and justice in the face of ambiguity and uncertainty.",
